    # Background of the Study
    st.markdown("## Background of the Study")
    st.markdown("""
    The SeekLiyab project was developed to address the growing need for improved fire safety systems due to the increasing number of fire incidents caused by delayed detection and response. Traditional fire alarms are often limited by outdated technology, lack of remote access, and slow alerts. 

    In response, SeekLiyab integrates modern IoT technology to enhance fire detection, real-time monitoring, and emergency response. The system uses IoT sensors and automated alerts to offer a proactive approach to fire prevention and control. This innovative project aims to enhance public safety, reduce property damage, and minimize the risks of fire-related disasters by applying emerging technologies in fire safety management.

    The study is driven by a commitment to enhance public safety, minimize property damage, and reduce the risks associated with fire-related disasters. Through extensive research, evaluation of existing systems, and application of emerging technologies, the researchers have developed a solution that is both innovative and practical.
