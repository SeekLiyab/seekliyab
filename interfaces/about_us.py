    The **SeekLiyab** real-time fire detection system was developed by a team of talented BS Electrical Engineering students who combined their expertise in IoT, embedded systems, and machine learning to create an innovative solution for early fire detection and monitoring.

    ### System Components:
    - **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 with multiple sensors
    - MCP9808 temperature sensor
    - MQ135 air quality sensor
    - MQ7 carbon monoxide sensor
    - MQ2 smoke detector
    - **Software**: Custom embedded programming and machine learning algorithms
    - **Interface**: Real-time monitoring dashboard with alert system

    The SeekLiyab project showcases the team's ability to apply their electrical engineering knowledge to develop practical solutions for real-world safety challenges.
